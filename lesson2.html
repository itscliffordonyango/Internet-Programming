    <h1>Properties of HTML and css </h1>
    <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages and web applications. It provides the structure of a webpage, allowing you to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other multimedia content. HTML uses tags to organize and format content, making it possible for web browsers to interpret and display the information correctly.

    <h1>Properties of CSS</h1>
    <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and layout of a webpage. It works alongside HTML to enhance the visual appearance of web content. CSS allows you to control various design aspects, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning of elements on a webpage. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), developers can create more flexible and maintainable web designs.
